        <h2>Secured Areas Data Definitions and Sources</h2>
        <p>The secured areas dataset shows public and private lands that are permanently secured against conversion to development through fee ownership, easements, or permanent conservation restrictions.</p>
        <p>Each parcel is classified by its GAP status: a classification developed by the US Fish and Wildlife service to reflect the intent of the landowner or easement holder.  GAP 1 and 2 are commonly thought of as “protected” land, while GAP 3 are “multiple-use”. </p>
        <h4 class="thinHeading">GAP Status Definitions</h4>

        <h4>GAP 1 = Permanently Secured for Nature and Natural Processes</h4>
        <p>An area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover and a mandated management plan in operation to maintain a natural state within which disturbance events (of natural type, frequency, intensity, and legacy) are allowed to proceed without interference or are mimicked through management</p>
        <h4>GAP 2 = Permanently Secured for Nature with Management </h4>
        <p>An area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover and a mandated management plan in operation to maintain a primarily natural state, but which may receive uses or management practices that degrade the quality of existing natural communities, including suppression of natural disturbance.	</p>
        <h4>GAP 3 = Permanently Secured for Multiple Uses including extraction and recreation</h4>
        <p>An area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover for the majority of the area, but subject to extractive uses of either a broad, low-intensity type (e.g., logging) or localized intense type (e.g., mining). It also confers protection to federally listed endangered and threatened species throughout the area.</p>
        <p>The Dataset is compiled from a mix of federal, state and local data sources:</p>
