                <strong>Indigenous Lands: </strong>
                <p>
                    The boundaries of the Indigenous lands come from the US Census Bureauâ€™s <strong>American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian (AIANNH)</strong> data set, and includes the following legal entities:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land areas</li>
                    <li>State-recognized American Indian reservations, and Hawaiian homelands (HHLs)</li>
                    <li>Statistical entities including Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs), tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs), and state designated tribal statistical areas (SDTSAs)</li>
                    <li>Joint use areas defined as areas that are administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes. The Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The boundaries for ANVSAs, OTSAs, and TDSAs were delineated for the 2010 Census through the Tribal Statistical Areas Program (TSAP) by participants from the federally recognized tribal governments. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) provides the list of federally recognized tribes and only provides legal boundary information when the tribes need supporting records, if a boundary is based on treaty or another document that is historical or open to legal interpretation, or when another tribal, state, or local government challenges the depiction of a reservation or off-reservation trust land.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The boundaries for federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands are as of January 1, 2017, as reported by the federally recognized tribal governments through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).
                </p>

                    Boundaries for Indigenous lands in Canada come from The Aboriginal Lands of Canada Legislative Boundaries (Government of Canada 2017) and includes legislative boundaries of Indian Reserves, Land Claim Settlement Lands (lands created under Comprehensive Land Claims Process that do not or will not have Indian Reserve status under the Indian Act) and Indian Lands.
