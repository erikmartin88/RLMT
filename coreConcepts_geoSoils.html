            <strong>Geology and Soils </strong>
                refer to the variety of soils and bedrock geology that explain basic biodiversity patterns of a region. Geology and soils area component of the Geophysical/Land facet type and used as a stratification template to ensure that we identified resilient examples of all species-relevant physical habitats.  Representation of all geophysical settings in conservation plans is critical because these sites provide the “stages” for current and future biodiversity.  Because biodiversity-geology relationships vary spatially, each study region developed its own set of appropriate geophysical settings/land facets through testing with known locations of biodiversity features.  Here, we integrate these into one map, but we encourage users to read the report for their study region to get details on the species-geophysical setting relationships.
