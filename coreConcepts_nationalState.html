        <p>
            The TNC Customized Resilient and Connected Network (RCN) represents a version of the national dataset that has been reviewed and augmented by science and conservation staff in each of The Nature Conservancyâ€™s seven North America Divisions. The augmentations reflect local site knowledge, field checking of connectivity linkages, and restoration work to restore resilience.  Most of the augmentations fall within the national RCN categories but new categories were added for restoration sites that were below the national resilience threshold but had recognized biodiversity value or diffuse flow.
