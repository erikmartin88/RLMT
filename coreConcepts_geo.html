            <strong>Geophysical Settings, </strong>
                also known as Land Facets, refer to the soils, geology, and elevation zones that explain basic biodiversity patterns of a region. We used geophysical settings as a stratification template to ensure that resilient examples of all species-relevant physical habitats will be represented in our conservation portfolios. These sites provide the “stages” for current and future biodiversity.  Because biodiversity-geophysical relationships vary spatially, each study region developed its own set of appropriate geophysical settings/land facets through testing with known locations of biodiversity features.  Here, we integrate these into one map, but we encourage users to read the report for their study region to get details on the species-geophysical setting relationships:   <a target="_blank" href="http://easterndivision.s3.amazonaws.com/Resilient_Sites_for_Terrestrial_Conservation.pdf">Eastern US</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://easterndivision.s3.amazonaws.com/Terrestrial/Great_Lakes_Resilience/Great_Lakes_and_Tallgrass_Prairie_Resilience_05_11_18.pdf">Great Lakes and Tallgrass Prairie</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://easterndivision.s3.amazonaws.com/GP_Resilience/Great_Plains_Resilience.pdf">Great Plains</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://tnc.box.com/s/q0kwq3r4aqi5ytl128o5m0rye4z01rtg">Lower Mississippi and Ozarks</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://tnc.box.com/s/cqz4dp69e34mptqml7anfr5ezy94hcyu">Rocky Mountains and Desert Southwest</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/oregon/science/Documents/PNW%20Terrestrial%20Climate%20Resilience%20Report%20March3%202015.pdf">Pacific Northwest</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://omniscape.codefornature.org/#/analysis-tour">California</a>
