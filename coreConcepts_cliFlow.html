                <strong>Connectivity and Climate Flow: </strong>
                    Climate flow refers to the gradual movement of populations in response to changes in the climate. Over time, climate flow results in range shifts and the formation of novel communities. We measured climate flow using a continuous wall-to-wall model of landscape permeability based on anthropogenic resistance (resistance to movement caused by human modification) and climatic gradients (upslope, northward and riparian). On the maps, brown indicates areas with low permeability where movement is blocked. Medium blue indicates areas of high permeability and moderate flow; often highly natural settings were species movements are diffuse. Dark blue indicates areas of highly concentrated flow where movements will accumulate or be channeled.
