        <strong>Landforms </strong> are used in this analysis as the base for estimating microclimate diversity (a.k.a. topoclimate diversity) because they subdivide landscapes into local topographic units with unique moisture and temperature profiles. The 19-24 individual landform units reflect local variation in land position, slope, solar radiation, moisture availability, and susceptibility to wind and other disturbances. Landform-based climatic variation can be on par with, or greater than the climatic variation expected over the next century, and because species experience climate at a very local scale (inches to yards), high microclimate variation allows species to persist at sites even when the regional climate appears unsuitable. For more information on the landform model see the report for your study region.
